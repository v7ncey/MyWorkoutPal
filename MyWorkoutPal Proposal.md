1\. PROBLEM STATEMENT (2-3 sentences)  
 Many beginner-to-intermediate gym-goers want to work out consistently but don’t know how to structure an effective plan (which muscles, how many days, what exercises, how long). This leads to wasted time, inconsistent progress, and quitting. MyWorkoutPal targets people who want a clear, personalized workout plan without needing a coach.

2\. SOLUTION (3-4 sentences)  
MyWorkoutPal is an MVP workout-generator app that builds a personalized routine from a short questionnaire (days/week, session length, goals, muscle groups, equipment access, experience level). The app outputs a weekly split plus a complete “today’s workout” (exercises, sets/reps, rest). Users can save plans and regenerate variations to avoid repetition while staying consistent. Core features: guided intake, workout generation, and plan/history saving.

3\. TARGET MARKET (1-2 sentences)  
Beginner/intermediate lifters, busy students/young professionals, and anyone returning to the gym who wants structure. U.S. demand pool includes \~77M gym/studio members (2024), with additional reach via home-gym and casual fitness users.

4\. WHY IT'S VALUABLE (1-2 sentences)  
Solves the biggest friction point: “I don’t know what to do today,” by generating a structured plan instantly. Business value: higher workout adherence → higher retention, plus premium upsells for personalization in a large and growing fitness app market.

5\. HOW YOU'LL MAKE MONEY (1-2 sentences)  
Freemium model: free workout generation \+ basic saving; premium subscription for advanced personalization (progressive overload, recovery-aware splits, unlimited plan history, analytics). Pricing benchmarked against existing fitness subscriptions (e.g., MyFitnessPal Premium).
